			<p class="pt-4 text-justify xl:text-xl">
				Hello World! I’m a software developer from India with 1.5 years of professional experience
				as a frontend and software developer. I’ve worked extensively with Vue, Vuetify, and Flutter
				to create intuitive and efficient applications. In my personal projects, I love building
				websites using SvelteKit and TailwindCSS, combining simplicity and performance to craft
				beautiful web experiences.
			</p>
			<p class="pt-4 text-justify xl:text-xl">
				I have a deep interest in graphics programming and love working with Rust to create
				efficient and elegant solutions. I use Arch Linux (btw) with a custom-configured setup
				featuring BSPWM as my tiling window manager. My development environment is terminal-focused,
				where I rely on Neovim for coding, Tmux for session management, and the command line for
				building and running projects.
			</p>
			<p class="pt-4 text-justify xl:text-xl">
				In addition to coding, I enjoy creating pixel art in Aseprite and developing games in the
				Godot Engine, combining my love for programming and art to bring creative projects to life.
				Whether I’m configuring my OS, crafting immersive games, or exploring new technologies, I’m
				always excited to build and learn.
